# Sardips

I wanted to make a virtual pet game for web-browsers. But I failed, I got caught up making too many systems to many minigames, Too many sardips (the pets), Too much food with a confusing stomach and taste system.

The long and short of it is too much scope, too little competence.

I strongly think not having a real game for the years on and off working on it dramatically made it less fun to work on. Just separate parts.


Anywhere here it is all that will be completed of this iteration.
